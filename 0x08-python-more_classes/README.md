# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Resources
Read or watch:

* [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)(Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
* [Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_object_oriented_programming.php) (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following paragraphs: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The __init__ Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “__str__- and __repr__-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
* [Class and Instance Attributes](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_class_and_instance_attributes.php)
* [classmethods and staticmethods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq8cL2XMM5M)
* [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
* [str vs repr](https://brennerm.github.io/posts/python-str-vs-repr.html)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is OOP
* “first-class everything”
* What is a class
* What is an object and an instance
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is an attribute
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
* What is self
* What is a method
* What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
* What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
* What is a property
* What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
* What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
* What are the special __str__ and __repr__ methods and how to use them
* What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__
* What is a class attribute
* What is the difference between a object attribute and a class attribute
* What is a class method
* What is a static method
* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
* How to bind attributes to object and classes
* What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
* How to use the getattr function

## Tasks
0. Simple rectangle mandatory
Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You are not allowed to import any module

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
Rectangle = __import__('0-rectangle').Rectangle

my_rectangle = Rectangle()
print(type(my_rectangle))
print(my_rectangle.__dict__)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ ./0-main.py
<class '0-rectangle.Rectangle'>
{}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ 
```

1. Real definition of a rectangle mandatory
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)

* Private instance attribute: width:
    - property def width(self): to retrieve it
    - property setter def width(self, value): to set it:
        * width must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message width must be an integer
        * if width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
* Private instance attribute: height:
    - property def height(self): to retrieve it
    - property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
        * height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer
        * if height is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message height must be >= 0
* Instantiation with optional width and height: def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
* You are not allowed to import any module

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ cat 1-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
Rectangle = __import__('1-rectangle').Rectangle

my_rectangle = Rectangle(2, 4)
print(my_rectangle.__dict__)

my_rectangle.width = 10
my_rectangle.height = 3
print(my_rectangle.__dict__)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ ./1-main.py
{'_Rectangle__height': 4, '_Rectangle__width': 2}
{'_Rectangle__height': 3, '_Rectangle__width': 10}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ 
```
2. Area and Perimeter mandatory
Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py)

* Private instance attribute: width:
  - property def width(self): to retrieve it
  - property setter def width(self, value): to set it:
        * width must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message width must be an integer
        * if width is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message width must be >= 0
* Private instance attribute: height:
    - property def height(self): to retrieve it
    - property setter def height(self, value): to set it:
        * height must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message height must be an integer
        * if height is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message height must be >= 0
* Instantiation with optional width and height: def __init__(self, width=0, height=0):
* Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the rectangle area
* Public instance method: def perimeter(self): that returns the rectangle perimeter:
    - if width or height is equal to 0, perimeter is equal to 0
* You are not allowed to import any module

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ cat 2-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
Rectangle = __import__('2-rectangle').Rectangle

my_rectangle = Rectangle(2, 4)
print("Area: {} - Perimeter: {}".format(my_rectangle.area(), my_rectangle.perimeter()))

print("--")

my_rectangle.width = 10
my_rectangle.height = 3
print("Area: {} - Perimeter: {}".format(my_rectangle.area(), my_rectangle.perimeter()))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ ./2-main.py
Area: 8 - Perimeter: 12
--
Area: 30 - Perimeter: 26
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x08$ 
```
